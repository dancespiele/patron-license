3.  You may build, and sublicense for, as many larger applications as you like.

## Notices

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the texts of both this license and the public license for this software.

## Excuse

If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with [Notices](#notices), you can keep your license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license under these terms ends immediately.

## Patent

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.

## Reliability

No contributor can revoke this license, but your license may end if you break any rules of these terms.
