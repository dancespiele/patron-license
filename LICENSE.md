# Patron License VERSION

Developer: [Developer's Name]

## Purpose

This license gives those supporting me as qualifying patrons permission exceptions to any noncommercial or copyleft rules of the public license for this software, while continuing to protect me from from liability.

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must qualify under [Patrons](#patrons) and agree to their rules.  Those rules are both obligations under our agreement and conditions to the license granted to you under these terms.  That agreement and your license continue only while you qualify as a patron.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.

## Patrons

To qualify as a patron for this license, you must be enrolled to send me regular payments through any public platform where I request payments in exchange for tiers of perks in amounts qualifying you for a tier of perks that includes patron licenses, or otherwise identifies this license.

## Scope

This license applies only to you.  However, if you combine this software with other software in a larger application, you may sublicense this software as part of your larger application, and allow further sublicensing in turn, under these rules:

1.  Your larger application must have significant additional content or functionality beyond that of this software, and end users must license your larger application primarily for that added content or functionality.

2.  You may not sublicense anyone to break any rule of the public license for this software for any changes of their own or any software besides your larger application.

3.  You may build, and sublicense for, as many larger applications as you like.

## Copyright

I license you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe my copyright in it.

## Notices

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the texts of both this license and the public license for this software.

## Excuse

If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with [Notices](#notices), you can keep your license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license under these terms ends immediately.

## Patent

I license you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims I can license or become able to license.

## Reliability

I cannot revoke any license granted under these terms, but your license may end if you break any rule of these terms.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and I will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***
